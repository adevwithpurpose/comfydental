        question: "Is dental treatment at Comfy Dental really pain-free?",
        answer: "Yes. We specialize in anxiety-free dentistry. By combining advanced techniques like Wand™ computer-aided anesthesia, conscious sedation, and a 'soft-touch' clinical approach, we ensure you feel comfortable and relaxed throughout your procedure.",
    },
    {
        question: "What exactly is Sleep Dentistry?",
        answer: "Sleep Dentistry (conscious sedation) allows you to undergo dental procedures in a state of deep relaxation. While you aren't completely unconscious like general anesthesia, you will be in a dream-like state and typically have little to no memory of the treatment afterward.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer smile previews before starting treatment?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We use AI-powered Digital Smile Design (DSD) to create a photorealistic simulation of your new smile. You can see, adjust, and approve your final look before we even touch a tooth.",
    },
    {
        question: "Where in Lahore are you located?",
        answer: "Comfy Dental is located on the 1st Floor, 81CCA, Sector C, DHA Phase 5, Lahore. We have dedicated parking and a premium, spa-like environment designed to reduce clinical anxiety.",
    },
    {
        question: "Are there flexible payment options available?",
        answer: "Yes, we believe premium care should be accessible. We offer transparent pricing and tailored 0% financing payment plans for major cosmetic and restorative procedures.",
    },
